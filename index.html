                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p class="skills">I was recently introduced to the field of Web Development and find myself to be passionate about it. I am acquainted with HTML and CSS and am currently learning JavaScript and intend to gain further knowledge in this sphere. I believe that this field strikes the perfect balance between creative work and analytical thinking which causes my inclination towards it. Besides this, I am also interested in marketing and content writing and my interest stems from the fact that this too requires creative thinking along with appreciable communication skills for being able to sell an idea or advertise a certain event/project, qualities, that I believe, I possess. My experience involves having worked in my school's student council from 9th-12th grade consecutively. I have been appointed as a sub-editor and later as the associate editor of the Editorial Board. I have led my team to win the interschool annual newspaper making contest which is judged by members of prestigious newspapers like Times of India, Hindustan Times, etc. Further, I went to Singapore as a Global Press Reporter in the Amity International Model United Nations wherein my responsibilities involved, writing articles and committee reports, for the newsletter, covering the events that occurred over a period of three days. Having said this, I am currently looking forward to joining clubs where I can learn, acquire several skills and connect with other like-minded people in the community.</p>
